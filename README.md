MadPhone thrives on collaboration. To make it interesting, we only show you one previous sentence for you reply to, and you can't see an entire story until the creator unlocks it. Think of it as a silly combination between madlibs and telephone.

Start contributing today in a number of easy steps:
Create a story on our creation page. Don't worry if you don't know what to write about - we give you suggestions.
Contribute to a story by adding a sentence to a random story on our contribution page. Alternatively, you can contribute to a specific story while you are viewing an incomplete story.
Browse through recently created stories to find one you want to contribute to, or read, vote, and comment on completed stories.

And that's all you need to know! Be sure to make your sentences count - you can't submit another one until someone else adds a sentence after yours.
